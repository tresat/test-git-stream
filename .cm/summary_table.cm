# The `automations` section lists automations to run on PRs in this repository.
# Each automation has an `if` key that defines conditions to run the automation,
# as well as a `run` key with the actions to do. All the conditions need to be true
# for the actions to run (there is an implicit AND relation between
# the conditions on each line).  Each condition is specified as a Jinja expression.  You
# can also use the constant `true` if you want to always run the actions.

# Each automation is independent of the others.  Every time one of the `on` conditions match for
# this PR, this automations will have its `if` checked to run.  In a way, the `on` conditions
# function as an implicit first `if` for every automation in the file.

# You can define multiple automations in a .cm file, but each automation name should be unique
# within the file.  We keep each automation (or very closely related group of automations) in
# its own file.
